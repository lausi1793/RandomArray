RandomArray
===========

Here I show you what you have to do to make a Array out of random Numbers. Java has a "Random" class that lets you generate a random number you use to implement calculations in your Java source code. You use this library to generate a random number and insert the number into an array variable index. You can add one or several random numbers into your array variables, but Java does not guarantee that each number is unique.
